Another competing consumer electronics store will be opening in the Crayville area on November 12.</p><p>In order to ensure that Topline Electronics does not lose business to this new store, District Management is advising you to run a special sale on our new line of curved UHD televisions. These televisions provide state-of-the-art features at moderate prices. By showing your customers that Topline Electronics offers the best deals in the area, you will be able to maintain customer loyalty. We will be shipping the new televisions to your store within the next week. We suggest you prepare a prominent display space in your store to feature them. You should also update your website to advertise the sale.</p><p>Smooth communication between you and us is vital to effective operational practices. If you have any questions concerning the new televisions or the marketing campaign in general, please don't hesitate to contact District Management.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Josh Fleck</p><p>District Manager,</p><p>Topline Electronics</p></div>",

Health Shack offers only six items on its menu; all are protein shakes including the best sellers, Apple Pie, Peanut Butter Cup, and Tuity Fruity. —[2]— \"We were overwhelmed by the response,\" says Jill Baker. \"In fact, everything spread by word of mouth so we didn't even need to advertise.\" Fitness Instructor Julian Miles said, \"I love coming here for a quick lunch that won't wreck my fitness goals. I even recommend this place to all my patrons.\" —[3]- \"I come here to get a healthy but satisfying meal during my short break with my co-workers,\" added businessman Tim Hammer. \"Without Health Shack, we'd be eating junk food.\" —[4]— Health Shack is open from 7:00 A.M. to 8:00 P.M. from Mondays through Fridays, and from 9:00 A.M. to 7:00 P.M. on Saturdays. It closes on Sundays. The owners hope to add new flavors to the menu in the coming months.</p>",

I am contacting you because I am interested in receiving regular shipments of fresh, organic vegetables to my restaurant weekly. My restaurant is just starting, so I do not need a large quantity of goods. After looking into different farms in the area, I chose to contact Bountiful Harvest because of your promise to deliver certified organic food. Therefore, I would like to receive a price estimate for the cost of having fresh vegetables delivered directly to our restaurant on a weekly basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emily Hall</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-------------------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>To</strong>: Emily Hall (emilyhall@zipline.com)<br />\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Bountiful Harvest (info@bountifulharvest.com)<br />\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: June 4<br />\r\n<strong>Subject</strong>: RE: Food Delivery</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dear Ms. Hall,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks for contacting our farm. At Bountiful Harvest, we offer fresh organic produce that can be delivered directly to a customer&#39;s location on a regular basis. Our vegetables are harvested from the field and delivered immediately, which means that you are getting wholesome, nutritious, organic produce to serve at your restaurant. We also offer additional items such as fresh meat, cheese, and milk. Below is a table detailing the various pricing options we offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Package Option</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Features</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Weight</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Delivery Frequency</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Price Per Delivery</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Personal</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>This package feeds approximately 2-3 people and contains fresh seasonal vegetables.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>5 lb.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Once a week</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$15</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Small</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>This package is ideal for small businesses and includes fresh seasonal vegetables.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>50 lb.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Once a week</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$140</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Medium</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>This package is for medium-sized businesses needing a constant supply of fresh vegetables and meats.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>130 lb.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Twice a week</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$500</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Large</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>This package is our largest package and includes vegetables, meats, and dairy products.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>250 lb.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Twice a week</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>$800</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>The prices listed above do not include the delivery price. Customers who do not pick up their packages in person will have to pay an extra $6 per package to be delivered. However, for customers who sign up for an entire year&#39;s worth of deliveries, we will deliver your package for free. The purchase of additional items will also affect the final price of your package. Additional options are available on our website. Payments can be made via cash, credit card, check, or money order on the day of delivery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know that our customers especially care about the quality of the food. Therefore, we offer a mini package free of charge so you can assess our food. Please call Greg Lemons at 555-8141 to take advantage of this opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indira Singh</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-------------------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>To</strong>: Bountiful Harvest(info@bountifulharvest.com)<br />\r\n<strong>From</strong>: Emily Hall (emilyhall@zipline.com)<br />\r\n<strong>Date</strong>: June 5<br />\r\n<strong>Subject</strong>: Harvest Schedule</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dear Ms. Singh,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for responding so promptly to my email. I appreciate the offer of the complimentary delivery, but I think I would like to just go ahead and set up regular deliveries. I may be interested in setting up a year&#39;s worth of deliveries, but I would first like to get a list of the range of produce that you will be offering through the different seasons. As I own a vegetarian restaurant, I will need to have an idea of the types of produce that will be delivered so I can prepare my menus accordingly. Thank you so much for your consideration, and I look forward to working with Bountiful Harvest!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kind regards,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emily Hall</p>\r\n</div>",

The most serious violation concerned the improper storage and labeling of food. All ingredients stored for later use must be labeled with an exact date and detailed contents. If we do not label containers properly, spoiled food could accidently be served to customers. We received relatively low grades for employee hygiene and the cleanliness of our facilities. All employees are required to wear their uniform and hairnet at all times and wash their hands after every bathroom visit. We also need to mop floors more often and keep them dry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to correct these poor situations, I will be posting a checklist that all employees will be required to complete every morning. It will include necessary preparations to ensure that we are not breaking any regulations. This measure will go into effect on January 29.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any questions about these changes, please bring them up at the staff meeting tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-------------------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NOTICE TO ALL EMPLOYEES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The checklist below must be signed by every employee on every day that they have a shift at Polito&#39;s Pizza. Only sign the task once it has been completed or checked. Failure to fill out the checklist with the date, time, and signature will be treated as a violation of Polito&#39;s new health standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>POLITO&#39;S CHECKLIST</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan=\"2\">Polito&#39;s</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Sun</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Mon</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Tue</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Wed</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Thu</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Fri</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Sat</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan=\"2\">Rotate Food</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>K.P.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>K.P.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>K.P.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>K.P.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>K.P.</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan=\"2\">Mop Floors</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>K.P.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>K.P.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>K.P.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>K.P.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>K.P.</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan=\"2\">Uniforms</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>K.P.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>K.P.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>K.P.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>K.P.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>K.P.</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td colspan=\"2\">Wash hands</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>K.P.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>K.P.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>K.P.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>K.P.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>K.P.</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>",
